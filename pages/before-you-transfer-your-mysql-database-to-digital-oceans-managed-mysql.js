          Before you Transfer your MySQL Database to Digital Ocean Managed MySQL
        </Text>

          MySQL has a lot of useful features, but is also very rigid and
          rule-based. This means making sure your new server is setup correctly
          and exporting and importing your data correctly can be a handful when
          transferring a MySQL database from your server to DigitalOcean’s
          managed MySQL. Making sure the settings in your DigitalOcean server
          matches your current setup can be crucial as well as making sure your
          schema is the same.

          Here’s a step-by-step guide I recently took to transfer a MySQL
          database to a managed DigitalOcean MySQL server.

          First I matched DigitalOcean’s Global SQL Modes with the old server.
          You can get a list of your old SQL Modes by running the following:
        </Text>
        <Snippet>select @@sql_mode</Snippet>
        <Text>
          Once you have a list you can make sure the match the Global SQL Modes
          section under your settings in your DigitalOcean database.

          Be mindful that DigitalOcean requires that your tables have primary
          indexes. This is very important for it’s automatic backups. If for
          some reason you need to disable this you can run the following before
          migrating or importing data:
        </Text>
        <Snippet>set session sql_require_primary_key = 0;</Snippet>
        <Text>
          Keep in mind this will have to be run before every session in case you
          end up running more than one.

          One big gotcha, too, is your server’s timezone! This is where
          DigitalOcean could step up the managed part of their service. To
          update the timezone for your DigitalOcean MySQL database can be done
          with the API. Setup your token from within DigitalOcean. Then you can
          use a service like Postman to run a few API requests. Rajkishore J.
          lays out some good instruction at
          https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/how-to-set-a-timezone-for-mysql-managed-database
          on how to update your DigitalOcean timezone via its API.

          Hopefully that’s a good start in getting your settings to match! Now
          you should be ready to setup your tables. To migrate my tables, I used
          DataGrip. There are other tools around like DBeaver and Sequel Pro for
          Mac. In DataGrip you can compare databases and run a migration
          including your views and routines. You can even customized the queries
          before you run them. This is where it might be helpful to set the
          session as mentioned earlier. Also, make sure your specific selectors
          reference the new database if the name is different, update or delete
          your definers, and make sure your engines are compatible with
          DigitalOcean. MyISAM is not.

          Once you’ve migrated your tables and everything else, you can simply
          use mysqldump to export your data to a local .sql file. There are a
          number of ways you can install mysqldump one of which is Brew if
          you’re on OSX. You’ve already run your migration so the structure is
          there. You just need to export the data so simply use the
          –no-create-info flag. For example you might run the following:
        </Text>
        <Snippet>
          mysqldump old --no-create-info
          --result-file=&quot;/Users/topher/table_data&quot;
        </Snippet>
        <Text>
          Now you have an .sql file full of inserts. Simply open the file or
          copy and paste the queries and run the insert statements. Sit back and
          relax. After the inserts are done you should be all set!!!
